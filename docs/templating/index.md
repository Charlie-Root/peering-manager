# Templating

Peering Manager comes with a built-in templating feature. This feature can be
used to generate configuration for routers as well as e-mails.

## Jinja2

The templating feature is based on
[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/); therefore templates must follow
Jinja2's syntax. To help you writing your templates, Peering Manager will
expose [variables](variables.md) and [filters](filters.md).

You can also use Jinja2 extensions by installing them in the Python
environment and asking Peering Manager to load them using the
`JINJA2_TEMPLATE_EXTENSIONS` setting.

## CLI

Tests can be performed via a terminal and the `render_configuration` command.
This command must be run from Peering Manager's virtual environment and can
take up to five arguments:

* `--limit [LIMIT]`: limit the configuration to the given set of routers
  (comma separated)
* `--input [INPUT]`: file to read the template from (default to stdin)
* `--output [OUTPUT]`: file to write the configuration to (default to stdout)
* `--trim`: remove new line after tag (keep them by default)
* `--lstrip`: strip whitespaces before block (keep them by default)

For example, to generate the configuration for a device called `router1` from
the standard input and printing it to the standard output, the command to run
will be:

```no-highlight
(venv) # echo '{{ router.hostname }} | python manage.py render_configuration --limit router1
...
```

## Examples

If you need some guidance before writing a template, you can take a look at
the following example templates. Please note these may not be ready to use for
you as they are maintained by the community. However, feel free to use them
and to change them at your convenience.
